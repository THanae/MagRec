The purpose of this code is to detect and analyse magnetic reconnection 
events in the solar wind. The code is divided in two parts: **data handler**, 
which takes care of the data import and transformation, and **magnetic_reconnection_dir**, 
which detects reconnection events, optimises parameters and analyses the data.

**Data handler**

_data_importer_: this part of the code obtains the probe data from 
Heliopy and converts them to a standardised data type (ImportedData) 
used in the rest of the code. The function used in the rest of the code 
is `get_probe_data(probe, start_date, start_hour, duration)`. 

_utils_: in utils, methods for the processing of ImportedData columns, 
and for plotting legends standards are implemented. The magnitudes of 
the magnetic field and velocity can be obtained, and derivatives of 
columns, as well as outlying elements, can be returned.

`orbit_with_spice`: this part of the code gets the Spice kernels of 
probes (`get_orbiter(planet, start_date, end_date,interval`) 
and planets (`get_planet_orbit(planet, start_date, end_date,interval`), 
which are useful to determine the distance between an object and the Sun 
rapidly. However, not all probes are implemented in Heliopy, so these 
methods cannot always be used.

`distance_with_spice`: this code obtains all the ImportedData of a probe 
within a certain radius of the Sun. As mentioned before, this method 
is not always useful as it requires an existing Spice kernel downloadable 
from Heliopy.

`imported_data_plotter`: as its name indicates, this file helps plotting 
the data with `plot_imported_data(imported_data, columns_to_plot, **kwargs)`.
The columns to plot are all the columns available by default.


**Magnetic Reconnection Directory**

`base_finder` and `correlation_finder`: these files define the reconnection 
searching part of the algorithm. They use known features of reconnection, 
and optimisation of parameters, to determine which events are reconnection 
events and which events are not

`finder_test`: this code detects reconnection events (with detection fo changes
in correlation) with 
`get_possible_reconnection_events(probe, parameters, start_time, 
end_time, radius, **kwargs)`, where radius is the maximum radius 
we are interested in. The events are returned in a csv file for more 
analysis.

`lmn_coordinates` and `mva_analysis`: additional tests are then run on the data 
transformed to LMN coordinates, and a final set of possible events are 
returned and plotted.

`mag_rec_finder`: code returning all events for a given probe with 
`df_magnetic_reconnection_events(probe, parameters, min_walen, 
max_walen, start_date, end_date, **kwargs)`. Both the correlation tests 
and the LMN tests are run with this function.

_parameter_optimisation_: grid searching and random searching have been 
implemented to determine the maximum Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) 
of a given set of parameters.

`reconnection_geometry, find_same_event, reconnection_temperature, 
distances_from_the_sun_statistics, reconnection_stats`: 
analysis methods were implemented to visualize the geometry of current 
sheets, find the same event detected by two probes (necessitating Spice 
kernels), and to investigate relations between the Alfven speed anf changes 
in temperature at the reconnection event. The code can also detetmine how long 
the probe spent at given distances from the Sun, and the number of reconnection 
events detected at given radii or given times.

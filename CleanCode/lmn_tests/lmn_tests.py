# is the magnitude or amplitude of the magnetic field in the L direction larger than in the M direction

# are there at least two of the following
# sign of Bl changes before and after the event
# Bn is close to zero
# changes in vl larger than changes in vm or vn
# correlations between vl and Bl change before and after the event

# walen test
# for that need walen speed
